</h3>

<p>Vim is one of the most popular text editors for programmers around world, specially those working in Unix/Linux environment. There are other alternatives like emacs and notepad++ for windows users. I have been working in Unix environment for more than 4 years now and Vim has been my favourite editor since I started my career as a programmer. One of the most intriguing feature of Vim is its ability to be configured according to one's taste. Also there is a very good community support which keeps bringing exciting plugins in the market to get the job done in most efficient way.</p>

<p>Recently, I switched to MacOSX from Windows ... finally ;-). I always wanted to switch to MacOSX for two reasons - <em>First - Its minimalistic look and Second - Power of Unix (part of mach kernel is derived from freeBSD and netBSD)</em>. Mac OSX comes preinstalled with all basic unix utilities which also includes VI editor. It is enough to get most of the job done. But those who love the GUI version can install the Mac port of VIM called MacVim.</p>

<p>Before installing macvim, I would recommned to install "brew" package manager for MacOSX. Brew is like APT (Advanced Packaging Tool) on Linux distros like Ubuntu. This is one of the must have utility for macOSX. Checkout brew homepage @ <a href="http://brew.sh">http://brew.sh</a></p>

<p>Steps for installing brew :</p>

<pre><code>$ open terminal
$ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

</code></pre>

<p>Steps for installing macvim :</p>

<pre><code>$ brew update 
$ brew install macvim
</code></pre>

<p>Add below line in your startup shell script :</p>

<pre><code>$ alias vi=mvim
</code></pre>

<p>Once above steps are completed you will be able to launch vim from terminal using <em>"vi"</em> command.</p>

<p>Enjoy coding ...</p>
